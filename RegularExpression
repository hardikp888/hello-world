^,Verify first character of string,^1,First latter should be 1
$,End of line,1$,Last latter should be 1
.,Match any single character,^1.1$,First latter should be 1 second should be any and last one should be 1
[….],Machtch single chaacter is availbale in bracket,^[123],First latter should be 1 or 2 or 3
[^….],First later should not one of the latter in bracket,^[^123],First latter should not be 1 or 2 or 3
\A,,,
*,Zero or more occurrence,a*,should contain any number of a (should contain only a)
,,^[abc].*,First latter should be a or b or c after that any number of any character
,,zb*.*[123],"First latter should be z , After that any number of b and at the end any nuber of 1 or 2 or 3"
+,One or more occurrence,a+,Should contail one or more a
,,a+.[b]+,Start with one or more a and end with one or more b
?,zero or one time occurrence,a?,should contain only a or nothing
,,^[abc]?[h]?,Should be start with one a or b or c and second latter 
{n},exact n number of occurrence,a{4},must have exact 4 a
"{n,}",Should have minimun n occurrence,"a{4,}",Must have minimum 4 a
"{n,m}",should have minimun n and maximun m occurrence ,"a{4,7}",Number of a should be minimuber 4 and maximum 7
a|b,either a or b,a|b,either a or b
(),Groups regular expressions and remembers matched text,(a{4}).(b{2}),"First 4 latter should be a then any one latter and last two latter shoulb be b.
e.g = aaaahbb
Group - 0 = aaaahbb (Group can get through matchers.group(0).
Group -1 = aaaa
Group-2 = bb
Note before get group you must call matchers.matches().If match not found than group not available."
(?:rexp),should not insert in group,(?:a{4}).(b{2}),"First 4 latter should be a then any one latter and last two latter shoulb be b.
e.g = aaaahbb
Group - 0 = aaaahbb (Group can get through matchers.group(0).
Group-1 = bb
